Gödel, Escher, Bach. A formidable book in all aspects. With a book of this length, complexity, and high level abstract thinking, the challenge is pulling some common thread throughout the entire book. Instead, of just one thread, Hofstader weaves many threads into a self-referential braid.

Some of the analogies come across as forced. Pehaps, this demonstrates some capacity of human intelligence. What Hoftstader finds to be a compelling "abstraction" accross ideas, concepts, etc. I find to 

For example, 

Many of the others. Perhaps, this is what is meant by "we all see the world differently."

I do like the core abstraction: that self-reference can be found, on some level, within the disparate works of Gödel, Escher, and Bach. To me this is the core and central thread that runs throughout the entire novel. The core analogy that is referred to over and over, woven into the core fabric of the entire novel. I am also compelled by the different senses evoked by the different mediums, . This makes me wonder, can we have some super chefs making self-referential tasting food? A fishy fish or a leafy leaf? Or how about a self-referential smell. I don't think my sense of smell can conceive such an odor. I can at least imagine a self-refential feeling: imagine tracing the surface of a Möbius strip. While we feel like we're continuing on forever, we ultimately retrace our own steps indefinitely.

The point, of weaving through these different kinds of self-reference is to arrive at the slam dunk conclusion: that human intelligence somehow depends on a sort of self-reference. Hofstader lists a bunch of different examples, I think by far the most interesting was the one on self-awareness. At some level, our self is aware of itself. QED self-reference. 

Does self-reference run like a core thread through human intelligence?
I don't think anyone can say for certain at this point. I do think that the brain must perform many operations which recursion could boost the power of. Of course, our own hardware is abstracted away, a tantalizing secret locked within each of us.


I wonder, if as Hofstadter proposes, that human intelligence is not intelligent enough to understand its own intelligence. Could human intelligence far exceed the complexity of any other human discovery? To truly understand intelligence, we must create it. Yet, to create intelligence, we must first understand it. A catch-22. I think this will be broken by accident. Someday, somehow we will hit the singularity. The terminator will rise from the deep ocean. 

At which level do we attempt to conceive of intelligence?
A reductionist level would lead us quickly into the realm of quantum mechanics and perhaps beyond. A holistic approach would try and comprehend.

I would like to add my own analogy to Hoftsadter's collection.

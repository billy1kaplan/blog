Today was the first day for RC Winter 1. Usually meeting lots of new people leaves me feeling completely drained and ready to hide deep within myself. Yet today, I found that meeting dozens of people could be both energizing and fun. There are some places with a unique energy. An invisible, permeating buzz. Truly addicting in a way.

I like how Nick, one of the founders, described RC as (ideally) a bio/ecosystem of diverse individuals. I felt like I'd taken a plunge into the jungle of excitement. Where I once found gray, desolate concrete, I found greenary teeming with life. There do not seem to be any predators or poisonous mushrooms in this jungle just yet, and I love to explore!

I am excited for the rest of the batch and inspired to create something impossible (hopefully).

I mostly worked on implementing the evaluator "machine" in the pseudo-assembly code to run in the simulator (Chapter 5.4). I also spent some time reviewing some algorithms from the Stanford I algorithms course and browsing the beautiful RC library.

It's hard to believe that I've already completed my first week of RC! So far the experience has been absolutely incredible. When surrounded with so many like-minded individuals, I feel like I have 10x the energy from when working. And that is a tremendous thing.

The people here are awesome, and RC is definitely an amazing community.

So far, I've implemented a lambda calculus interpreter, explainer, and some simple lambda calculus functions. I've also done a decent amount of pair programming on an OCR menu voice app and automatic markdown converter. I'm starting on Raymond Smullyon's "To Mock a Mockingbird" which is a collection of combinatory logic puzzles. I've also some of the post lunch interview preps.

Also, shadertoy is so cool.

Next week I will move on to working on a Scheme compiler in C, doing the fast.ai course, continuing PLP, and doing some competitive programming through the UVA online judge.
